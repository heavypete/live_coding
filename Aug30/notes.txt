Live Coding: From setTimeOut to Promise-classic to Promise-async/await to IIFE
Create a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript website that shows a message after 3 seconds with setTimeout()
Wrap the setTimeout in a Promise and consume the promise with classic promise syntax
Convert the classic promise syntax to async/await
Convert the async/await syntax into an IIFE


IIFE = immediately invoked function expression.


Example of an IIFE :

var name = "Aiman"

(function(a,b) => {
    var name = 'john';
    console.log(name);
})();

console.log(name)

a nameless function that wraps another function(?).  The only place you can use 'await.'  
Edward says they are not named, because they are immediately called and only once.


IIFE was formerly used for class design patterns - 2004.
